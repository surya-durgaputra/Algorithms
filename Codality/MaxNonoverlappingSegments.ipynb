    "Letâ€™s scan from left to right, according to the end points. Since the input has already been sorted with the end points, linear scan works. Firstly, we define the cluster as: let the first item of that segment be segment[i], the cluster is all the segments from segment[i] to segment[j] (both inclusive, and i <= j), such that:\n",
    "for all x (i < x <= j), segment[i].begin <= segment[x].begin <= segment[i].end\n",
    "\n",
    "Any two segments in one cluster are overlapping.\n",
    "1. Because the segments are sorted as the end point, (that is, for all x (i < x <= j), segment[x].end >= segment[i].end), and the definition of cluster, all the other segments are overlapping with the first one.\n",
    "2. Any two no-first segments are overlapping. Because both their begin points are <= segment[i].end, and both end points are >= segment[i].end.\n",
    "End of proof. As a result, in one cluster, we can pick up AT MOST one segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any two consecutive clusters, we can choose two segments MAXIMUMLY. Let cluster[i] be the i(th) cluster, and cluster[i].segment[j] be the j(th) segment in the i(th) cluster.\n",
    "1. We CAN choose two. As the definition of cluster, we have:\n",
    "cluster[i].segment[first].end < cluster[i+1].segment[first].begin\n",
    "And with the definition of segment, we have:\n",
    "cluster[i].segment[first].begin <= cluster[i].segment[first].end < cluster[i+1].segment[first].begin <= cluster[i+1].segment[first].end\n",
    "Therefore, they (cluster[i].segment[first] and cluster[i+1].segment[first]) are not overlapping.\n",
    "2. We can choose two AT MOST. If we can choose three or more non-overlapping segments in these two consecutive clusters, according to pigeonhole principle, at least two non-overlapping segments are in one cluster. But according to our previous discussion, it is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can proof that: with N clusters, we can pick up N non-overlapping segments at most. Therefore, the orginal question becomes: find the number of clusters in the segments."
